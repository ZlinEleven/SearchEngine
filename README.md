# SearchEngine

Homework #7 for my CSE214 class. The SearchEngine project uses graph theory to map websites and their links to each other. 
Each web page contains an index, url, rank, and keywords which users use to access the web graph. This program is a menu-
driven application in which users are allowed to add and remove pages and links as well as sort pages by certain criterias.
